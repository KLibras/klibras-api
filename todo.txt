    Add aio-pika: Integrate the library to send and receive messages from RabbitMQ.

    Change the Recognition Endpoint: Modify /check_action to send a job to the queue and immediately return a job ID.

    Create a Background Worker: Write a separate Python script that listens to the queue, calls the process_video_and_predict_action function, and saves the result.

    Add a Results Endpoint: Create a new GET endpoint for clients to check the status and get the results of a job.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

    Use Amazon RDS: Move your MySQL database to a managed RDS instance for better performance and scalability.

    Use Amazon MQ or SQS: Set up a managed message queue on AWS instead of running it yourself.

    Deploy on EC2: Run your application and workers on a CPU-Optimized (or GPU) EC2 instance.

    Use Gunicorn: Run your FastAPI application using Gunicorn with multiple Uvicorn workers to handle concurrent requests.
